# Loan Data Analysis EDA Project

This project explores and analyzes loan data to understand various factors that influence loan approvals. It uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques and visualizations to reveal key insights.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `LoanDataAnalysis.ipynb`: Main Jupyter Notebook containing the full analysis.
- `data/`: Directory containing the dataset (if applicable).

## 📊 Project Goals

- **Understand loan approval rates** across different demographic and financial factors.
- **Identify trends and patterns** in income, loan amount, and property area.
- **Visualize data** to spot correlations and outliers.

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **Semiurban areas** show higher loan approval rates compared to rural and urban areas.
- Applicants with **lower income** tend to receive lower loan amounts.
- Some categorical features (like **Education**, **Married**, **Property_Area**) significantly influence loan approval rates.

## 💡 Technologies Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQL Server for initial data extraction (if applicable)

## 🏁 How to Run the Notebook

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sudesh-co/LoanDataAnalysisEDAPRoject.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project folder and launch Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    cd LoanDataAnalysisEDAPRoject
    jupyter notebook
    ```
3. Open `LoanDataAnalysis.ipynb` and run the cells.

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Incorporate **predictive modeling** for loan approval.
- Add **interactive dashboards** with Plotly/Dash.
- Clean and expand the dataset for deeper insights.
